    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p class="recipe-p">This is a sacred family recipe that I have been commissioned from on high to bestow upon you today. A breakfast <em>(lunch and/or dinner)</em> that begins with decadent cinnamon squares and finishes with a sweet, milky mustache. <strong>Yum!</strong></p>
        <p></p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>General Mills Cinnamon Toast Crunch <em>(brand name is a <strong>must</strong>)</em></li>
                <li>Milk <em>(the family recipe calls for the fresh, utter-to-pale variety but substitute as needed)</em></li>
            </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Pour contents of cereal box into a large mixing bowl until it is about half full.</li>
                <li>Add desired amount of milk to bowl. <em>(It is preferable to saturate all cinnamon squares to maximize sugar solubility, however, this is left to cook's choice)</em></li>
                <li>Add spoon and enjoy!</li>
            </ol>
            <p></p>
            <strong>Pro-Tip: keep your milk-cereal ratio even by audibly slurping the excess milk regularly.</strong>
